# TO-DO-LIST-APP

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a simple To-Do List application using Python's Tkinter library. The application aims to help users efficiently manage their tasks by providing basic functionalities, such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks. 

This project serves as an introduction to GUI programming in Python, demonstrating essential skills such as:

User Interface Design: Creating a graphical interface that is user-friendly and allows for easy interaction with the task list.
Data Handling: Implementing basic data structures (lists) to store tasks and file handling techniques to persist data across sessions.

Event-Driven Programming: Using events and callbacks to respond to user actions (e.g., button clicks).
Software Development Best Practices: Organizing code using classes, methods, and functions to promote modularity and reusability.

The end goal is to provide a functional application that not only helps users stay organized but also demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in Python.
